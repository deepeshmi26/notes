To understand when to use webpack & when to use vite, first understand why vite is faster than webpack. If the write up seems too long, read the TLDR's.
## ⚡ Why Vite Is Faster Than Webpack

Vite achieves faster builds not by doing the same work quicker, but by **doing less work overall** — and doing it smarter.

### 🧩 Key Reasons

1. **esbuild for dependencies**  
   - Vite uses `esbuild` (written in Go, which supports parallelism in build process) to pre-bundle `node_modules`.
   - It’s 10–100× faster than Webpack’s JS-based loaders(single threaded).  
   - Dependencies are cached in `.vite/deps` and reused across builds.

2. **Separate graphs for app & dependencies**  
   - Vite splits the build into two parts:  
     - **Dependencies** → pre-bundled once.  
     - **App code** → rebuilt as needed.  
   - Rollup re-analyzes only your app graph, not the dependencies.

3. **Timestamp-based invalidation**  
   - Vite checks file timestamps instead of computing hashes.  
   - This makes change detection nearly instantaneous.

4. **Global cache (vs per-loader cache)**  
   - Webpack caches each loader’s output separately.  
   - Vite has a single global pre-bundle cache, reducing overhead.

5. **Native ESM Dev Server**  
   - During dev, Vite serves source files directly as ES modules.  
   - No upfront bundling → instant server startup.

6. **Rollup for production builds**  
   - Rollup’s static analysis and tree-shaking produce smaller, cleaner chunks.  
   - Dependencies from esbuild are reused, avoiding redundant work.

### 🧠 TL;DR
> Vite is faster because it pre-bundles dependencies once, caches them smartly, and rebuilds only the parts of your app that actually change — while Webpack reprocesses more on every build.


## 📦 Why Vite Produces Smaller Chunks Than Webpack

Vite’s output is typically smaller because it builds purely for **modern JavaScript (ESM)**  
and avoids the extra runtime and compatibility code Webpack adds to support older module systems and loaders.

### 🧩 Key Reasons

1. **Modern ESM-only module system**
   - Vite (via Rollup) handles only **ES modules (`import` / `export`)**.
   - Webpack supports **multiple formats** — ESM, CommonJS (`require`), and UMD.
   - This design difference leads to:
     - **No injected runtime:** Rollup outputs pure ESM that browsers understand directly,  
       while Webpack injects a small runtime (`__webpack_require__`, module cache, etc.)  
       to emulate CommonJS behavior.
     - **Aggressive static tree-shaking:**  
       Rollup safely removes unused exports thanks to static ESM imports.  
       Webpack must be conservative since CommonJS exports can mutate at runtime.
     - **No format conversion overhead:**  
       Rollup bundles ESM directly without wrapping each module.

   > ✅ Simpler module handling → no emulation layer → less dead code → smaller bundles.

2. **Automatic, static chunk splitting**
   - Rollup splits code automatically based on static imports and dynamic `import()` calls.
   - Webpack can achieve the same with configuration (`splitChunks`), but defaults are heavier.

   > ⚡ Smarter default splitting → smaller, more cacheable chunks.

3. **Simpler transformation pipeline**
   - Webpack runs files through multiple loaders (Babel, CSS, etc.), each adding some boilerplate.
   - Rollup uses a lighter plugin system that processes transformations once.

   > 🧰 Fewer transformation layers = cleaner emitted code.

### 🧠 TL;DR
Vite outputs smaller chunks because it targets only ESM, avoiding runtimes and wrappers, performs cleaner tree-shaking, and splits code more efficiently by default.


## ⚙️ When to Use Vite vs Webpack

Vite and Webpack serve the same purpose but focus on different needs.

### ⚡ Use **Vite** when
- You’re building a **modern ESM-based frontend** (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.).
- You want **fast startup, rebuilds, and hot reloads**.
- You don’t need to support **CommonJS or legacy code**.
- You prefer **simple setup and smaller output** out of the box.

> Best for: modern SPAs, component libraries, or any new browser-only project.

---

### 🧱 Use **Webpack** when
- You have **legacy dependencies** or use `require()` / CommonJS modules.
- You need **Node.js or hybrid (SSR) builds**.
- You want **fine-grained build control** (custom loaders, asset handling, plugin tuning).
- You’re maintaining a **large or mixed environment**.

> Best for: enterprise apps, SSR setups, or complex build pipelines.

### 🧭 TL;DR
| Scenario | Choose |
|-----------|---------|
| Modern frontend app | ⚡ **Vite** |
| Legacy or Node-based project | 🧱 **Webpack** |
| Need speed and simplicity | ⚡ **Vite** |
| Need compatibility and control | 🧱 **Webpack** |

> 🧠 **Rule of thumb:** Use Vite for modern apps. Use Webpack when compatibility or heavy customization matters.
